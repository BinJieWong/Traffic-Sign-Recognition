# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This project explores deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, and RNN, for traffic sign detection and classification to improve autonomous vehicles and ADAS. By addressing challenges like varying lighting, weather, and occlusions, the aim is to enhance system reliability, traffic safety, and overall road user experience in real-time environments
